# About The Project

What's Chillin'? is an app developed for anyone age 4+ that has any part of the grocery consuming or list making process in any home. Users are able to create an account, join other familiy members in a "Home" and share messages as well as update which food items are in which storage location as well as help build the next grocery list for that home. Members will also be prompted when any food item they have in their homes is expired, allowing them to either discard that item or add it to the next grocery list.

- Javascript
